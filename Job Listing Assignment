Gaining the experience needed for a job I would get right after I receive my degree is one of my main focusses currently.  To do so, I will be taking any and all courses that I believe could help me in the work force in the future, or give me an edge on other possible employees.  I will also be looking for an internship in the IT field over each remaining summer here at ISU, and during the school year if at all possible.  To receive the type of jobs I would like out of college, I will need to build my resume up with experience in several programming languages, web development, and general computer skills I hope to gain from college and internships.  Demonstrating that I am a good student with a relatively high grade point average is also a goal of mine. If I see an opportunity to Minor in a field that I think would help, I could also do that to gain an edge on other employees.  Going to job fairs and presentations by those already in the IT work force will also give me background knowledge that will be valuable for getting a job out of college.  As for the jobs I could get in five to eight years, most of the experience I would need for those will have to come from the job(s) I receive straight out of college.  Once I am working I will be able to further develop communication, technologic, and other basic skills that other employers will be looking for in more experienced possible employees.  Most all of the job listings included a minimum amount of preferred work in the area in order to be hired.  There is no way for me to gain this kind of experience before I graduate college.  After college I will focus on gaining that kind of valuable experience that will allow me to get a better and higher paying job.  In addition to these ways of learning, I believe that this class will also teach me
